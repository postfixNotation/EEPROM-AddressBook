# EEPROM-AddressBook
This source code shows the implementation of an address book based on a "Microchip" microcontroller (PIC16LF15345), a "STMicroelectronics" EEPROM (M24C08) using I2C and a UART (FTDI) based PC communication. This project is part of a computer science course and has been implemented during an intership (cooperative studies).
The source code has been written using "MPLAB X IDE 4.05" and "XC (v1.44)" as a C compiler. You can user "HTERM" or "GTKTERM" as terminal program. The UART interface has been implemented for 9600 Baud.
